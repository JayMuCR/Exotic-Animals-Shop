# Exotic-Animals-Shop
This is my final project for my Programming IV course. This is a shop created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, WebServices and MySQL.

It has a login page, where the user can authenticate themselves or create a new account. Stored procedures are used in order to maintain security of the information of the database.
It has a main page, where the user can see the list of the available animals for sale. If the users select one category it will open a new page with a description of the animal, its price and they will be able to add to cart for purchase.
It has a tab called other/services, where I have implemented some Webservices for different options: 
1- Id verification: It helps to verify if an ID is valid or not.
2- Phone number verification: It helps to verify if a phone number is valid or not.
3- Card verification: It helps to verify if a card number is valid or not.
4- Internal API to show all animals, their price and their description.
5- Payment verification: It helps to verify if a payment has been received or not.
